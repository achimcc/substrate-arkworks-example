## Benchmarking

You can run the included benchmarks of the Substrate extrinsics on your local machine with:

```shell
gh repo clone https://github.com/achimcc/substrate-arkworks-examples
cd substrate-arkworks-examples
make install 
make benchmark
```

The results are then written into a benchmark.pdf file.

An overview and comparison of all benchmark results can be found [here](https://github.com/achimcc/substrate-arkworks-examples/blob/main/benchmarks-comparison.md).
